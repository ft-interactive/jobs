/*
    THIS FILE HAS BEEN EDITED so the polyfill version of rAF is used in all browsers.

    EXPLANATION:

    Chrome suddenly started showing bizarre animation behaviour, after an update. It was failing to stop animating for some reason - the globe was just spinning continuously, missing its 'destination' and continuing to spin forever, in a wobbly sort of way.
    
    As this was specific to Chrome, which has its own native rAF implementation (not sure if it's webkit-prefixed or not), I suspected this was due to a change in that native implementation. So I have commented out some lines below so that now ALL browsers get the polyfill version of the function (i.e. it sets window.requestAnimationFrame to the homemade polyfill, even if a native version exists).

    Although this is overzealous (I could still use the native implementation on non-Chrome browsers, where available), it doesn't cause any noticeable performance hit, so I'm leaving it like this for now.
